# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems, organized by problem categories and difficulty levels.

## üìå Overview

LeetCode is a fantastic platform to practice coding skills, strengthen problem-solving abilities, and prepare for coding interviews. This repository serves as a personal record of my journey through solving LeetCode challenges.

### üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

The repository is structured into different categories based on problem type and difficulty level:

- **Arrays**  
- **Strings**  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Dynamic Programming**  
- **Trees & Graphs**  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**  
- **Math & Number Theory**  
- **Bit Manipulation**  
- **Others**

### üí° How to Use

- Each folder contains individual files named according to the problem title or ID, e.g., `001_Two_Sum.py`.
- Inside each file, you will find:
  - A brief description of the problem statement.
  - My solution with comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.

### üîß Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: [Mention the language used, e.g., Python, C++, Java]
- **IDE**: [Optional: Mention any specific IDE or coding environment used]

### ‚ú® Highlights

- Solutions cover problems from a range of difficulties: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.
- Various algorithmic techniques are implemented, including but not limited to:
  - Sorting, searching, and divide-and-conquer strategies.
  - Dynamic programming, memoization, and recursion.
  - Greedy algorithms, graph traversal, and tree manipulation.
